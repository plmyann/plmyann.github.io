Welcome to the [**Ziel Lab** (Zhang Integrative Ecology Lab)](/)—where passion for ecology meets scientific discovery. With zeal and precision, we’re a team of curious explorers who study ecosystems to understand and protect the natural world, working toward a sustainable future.

<ins>Our work focuses on three interconnected areas:</ins>

[**Biodiversity Science**]()

We explore changes of biodiversity patterns and the underlying mechanisms to provide the evidence base for conservation under global change. This ranges from processes influencing our estimation on biodiveristy dynamics, to causal infereneces to biodiversity change, expecially when multiple factors are related to the change.

[**Movement Ecology and Connectivity Conservation**]()

We track animal migrations using GPS and satellite technology to understand their journeys and safeguard their habitats. From shorebirds to insects, we follow nature’s travelers.

[**Human-nature interactions**]()

We build data-driven models to predict how ecosystems respond to environmental changes like deforestation or climate shifts. Our models guide conservationists and policymakers toward impactful decisions.
