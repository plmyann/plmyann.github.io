Welcome to the **[ZIEl Lab (Zhang Integrative Ecology Lab)](/)**—where passion for ecology meets scientific discovery. With zeal and precision, we’re a team of curious explorers who study ecosystems to understand and protect the natural world, working toward a sustainable future.

[<ins>Our work focuses on three interconnected areas:</ins>](/)

**[Biodiversity Science](/)**

We explore changes of biodiversity patterns and the underlying mechanisms to provide the evidence base for conservation under global change. This ranges from processes influencing our estimation on biodiveristy dynamics (e.g., sampling and monitoring schemes), to causal infereneces to biodiversity change, expecially when multiple factors are involved to the change.

**[Movement Ecology and Connectivity Conservation](/)**

We track animal movements using satellite tracking technology and lab environments of springtail (*Collembola*) to understand their movement journeys and investigate how to translate movement behaviours into long-term population persistence. This allows for incorporating more movement behaviours into connectivity conservation and providing more effective and efficient conservation strategies.

**[Human-nature interactions](/)**

We model different interactions between people and nature from the perspective of [personalised ecology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2018.09.012), i.e., the investigation of the direct interactions between individual people and nature and their ecological dimensions. We are interested comprehending in how human cultures can influence our unique and personalised interactions with nature and how those interactions can influence our understanding of nature and conservation outcomes in return.
