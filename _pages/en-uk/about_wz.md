__Intro__： I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the School of Life Science, at Nanjing University. I am an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented conservation biologist, trained in ecology, ornithology, conservation biology from McGill, Oxford and Tsinghua Universities. I strive to understand biodiversity patterns and dynamics and how different processes and mechnisms can influence our understanding. Towards this end, I do modelling and empirical research to improve our ability to monitor and estimate biodiversity change. I have also worked on tranforming movement behaviours into long-term populuation persistence based on both wildlife tracking data and experiments in the lab. If you’re a prospective student or postdoc, please also see the __[opportunities](/opportunities/)__ page.

__Career__: Before Nanjing University, I was a postdoctoral fellow with __[Andy Gonzalez](https://www.thegonzalezlab.org/about-andrew-gonzalez)__ and __[Laura Pollock](https://qbiodiversity.org/about/)__ at the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science([QCBS](https://qcbs.ca)) at the Department of Biology at McGill University. My research there had two major components: theoretical movement ecology (understanding the causes, patterns and mechnisms of organismal movements and their relationship with populaltion dynamics) and connectivity conservation planning (the design of conservation tools to protect connectivity and facilitate movement under global change). 

I was a DPhil student under the supervision of __[Ben Sheldon](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/ben-sheldon)__, __[Rich Grenyer](https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/our-community/people/professor-richard-grenyer/)__ and __[Kevin Gaston](http://kevingaston.com/biography/)__ at the Department of Zoology (now [the Department of Biology](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/home)) of the University of Oxford, where I studied the processes that influence our estimation and understanding of biodiversity, and investigated their implications for conservation from multiple scales. In 2018, I graduated from [Department of Earth System Science](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University with a MSc degree in Ecology, specialising in species distribution of migratory birds under the supervision of __[Yali Si](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/yali-si)__.
