I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the School of Life Science, at Nanjing University. I am an interdisciplinary, problem-oriented conservation biologist, trained in ecology, ornithology, conservation biology from McGill, Oxford and Tsinghua Universities. I strive to understand how social-ecological systems can be transformed to be both better and wilder (‘better’ including considerations of justice). Towards this end, I do modeling and empirical research to improve the management and governance of social-ecological systems. I have worked on ecosystem services for years (while recognizing and working on the concept’s limitations), including cumulative impacts. Now my work is focused on understanding the opportunities for bold positive change, socially and ecologically (with themes of rewilding, transformative change, relationality, and values). If you’re a prospective student or postdoc, please also see the opportunities page.

__History__: Before Nanjing University, I was a postdoctoral fellow with [Andy Gonzalez](https://www.thegonzalezlab.org/about-andrew-gonzalez) and [Laura Pollock](https://qbiodiversity.org/about/) at the Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science([QCBS](https://qcbs.ca)) at the Department of Biology at McGill University. My research there had two major components: theoretical movement ecology (understanding the causes, patterns and mechnisms of organismal movements and their relationship with populaltion dynamics) and connectivity conservation planning (the design of conservation tools to facilitate movement under global change). I was a DPhil student under the supervision of [Ben Sheldon](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/ben-sheldon), [Rich Grenyer](https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/our-community/people/professor-richard-grenyer/) and [Kevin Gaston](http://kevingaston.com/biography/) at [the Department of Biology](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/home) of the University of Oxford, where I studied the processes that influence our estimation and understanding of biodiversity, and investigated their implications for conservation from multiple scales. In 2018, I graduated from [Department of Earth System Science](https://www.dess.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University with a MSc degree in Ecology, specialising in species distribution of migratory birds under the supervision of [Yali Si](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/yali-si).
