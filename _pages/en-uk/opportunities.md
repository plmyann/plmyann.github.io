__Prospective master and PhD Students:__ I am looking for rigorously trained students interested in ecological approaches to understanding the complexity of nature and tackling the challenges of global change. I hope candidates would sooner work in an inclusive, interdisciplinary lab that values multiple perspectives of science, and be willing to collaborate in the fieldwork, laboratory, and quantatitive modelling. I am not wedded to any topic or idea but rather motivated by a zeal for both application and advancing fundamental insight. Albeit with recognising the importance of disciplinary traditions for successful scholarship, I welcome candiates from different disciplinaries without consideration for boundaries between ecology and others. Ideal candidates will be savvy about one or more of the following and interested in at least three: (a) biodiversity dynamics; (b) quantitative analysis and modelling; (c) social systems, especially the role of human cultures in understanding biodiversity change; (d) global change; (e) animal movements; (f)connectivity science (especially network science); (g) species interactions.

__Prospective Postdocs__: I am recruiting two postdocs on (a) __animal movements and connectivity science__ and (b) __biodiversity dynamics__. Announcements will be coming soon, but if you are interested in themï¼Œ please feel free to __[contact me](/contacts/)__.
